# Variables
## types of variables = numbers or strings
## must be assigned before being used
## the value within a variable can later be accessed or changed

# Python Variable Name Rules
## Must begin w/ a letter or underscore.
## Other characters can be letters, numbers, or underscores.
## Case sensitive.
## Can be any (reasonable) length.
## There are some reserved words which you cannot use 
## as a variable name because Python uses them for other things. 

# Good Variable Naming
## Descriptive names instead of short names. Red_ball > rb.
## Maintain the length of a variable name. red_ball_rolling_south_direction = too long. 
## Consistency. red_ball + blue_ball or RedBall + BlueBall.
## Begin a variable name w/ underscores for special cases. 


# variable_name = ("value")
# the equal sign assigns the value (right) to the variable (left).
